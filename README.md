fun with the new HoloLens SDK since the real hololens is $3000 more than i can afford :D


after playing with the emulator a bit, here's my notes:

### annoying things
 - install only works to C drive
 - huge install requirements (mostly nitpicking tbh, if using 20gb of space on my ssd means saving $3000, then i'd rather do it :p)
 - mouse cursor often goes out of simulator window, perhaps microsoft should try adding a keybinding to have video-game-style mouse cursor movements (ie mouse cursor is stuck in middle of window)
 - ~~emulator sometimes gets stuck in this mode~~ sometimes, if you hit the remap key (T), the emulator gets stuck like this (i have a room loaded): [screenshot 78](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6683648/14234733/31404898-f9b8-11e5-8e49-be7c86d21877.png) i had to relaunch to fix (note from later - i hit escape and it closes now, don't think it worked before o.O)
 - emulator stuck with gray screen sometimes (maybe it's because i was calibrating? :p) everything still works, but you can't see anything: [screenshot 79](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6683648/14234744/c04b36c4-f9b8-11e5-80d6-1657070c38a6.png)
 - scrolling doesn't work in the hologram app i think, (mouse wheel and "tap and hold" gesture both don't scroll) and you're forced to use the page down button

### gestures
some of this is covered here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/using_the_hololens_emulator#Basic_Emulator_Input

 - the best way to learn gestures is to click the windows button and then select "Learn Gestures" (it's teal/bright blue) by right-clicking.
 - left click and drag to look around (moving your head)
 - right click and hold = "finger sticking up gesture" (aka "ready to select")
 - right click - select item
 - in the learn thing it says "tap and hold" (aka alt and hold right click) is used for scrolling, but the mouse wheel works for scrolling, at least in edge.
 - saying select to select an item doesn't work for me atm, either the way i'm speaking is weird, the mic is off, or something else.

walking and whatnot (movement):
 - Q rotate head/screen clockwise
 - E rotate head/screen counterclockwise
 - T is remap key
 - ALT locks where you're looking at (so you can't move your head)
 - SHIFT plus a movement key (WASDQE) makes that movement faster
 - (other bits can be found on the hololens site linked above)
